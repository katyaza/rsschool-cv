## About Me
In 2018, I graduated with honors from the university with a degree in economics and worked as economists for 4 years, my work was appreciated and I constantly grew up the career ladder.

Over time, I realized that my work is very routine and does not bring me pleasure, but there were moments that fascinated me, for example, I could develop conditions for automating and speeding up repetitive tasks. Taking a risk, I decided to leave a stable job and try myself in development, for half a year I have been taking various courses and studying documentation. At the moment.

I believe that I am close to my goal.

As far as my strengths is great desire and ability to learn, ability to work in a team. Accuracy in work and a sense of responsibility for the result.
